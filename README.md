# St.Ambrose-String-Graph
This program was worked on over the whole semester. I created a String Graph that takes in string vertices, and 
creates a graph from it. It has basic methods such as addVertex, addVertices, deleteVertex, addEdge, addEdges, 
and deleteEdge. There are more complex methods as well, such as the shortestPath method that finds the shortest
path between two points.
